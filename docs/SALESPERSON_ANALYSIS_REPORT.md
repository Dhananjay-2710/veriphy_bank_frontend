## 🎯 BUSINESS LOGIC

### Customer Assignment
```
Manager → Sets customers.user_id = salesperson_id
         ↓
Salesperson → Sees customer in "My Customers"
             ↓
Salesperson → Creates case for customer
             ↓
System → Sets cases.assigned_to = salesperson_id
```

### Performance Calculation
```
Materialized View (salesperson_performance):
- Aggregates all customer data
- Counts cases by status
- Sums loan amounts
- Calculates metrics
- Updates via refresh_salesperson_performance()
```

### Leaderboard Ranking
```
View (team_leaderboard):
- Calculates conversion rates
- Computes target achievement
- Ranks within team (PARTITION BY team_id)
- Ranks overall (PARTITION BY organization_id)
- Performance score = weighted formula
```
