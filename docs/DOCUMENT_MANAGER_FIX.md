# 🔧 DOCUMENT MANAGER FIX APPLIED

## 🔴 ISSUE FOUND

**Problem:** Document Manager page was not opening/working
**Root Cause:** Multiple issues in document querying and organization filtering

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Added Organization Filtering
**File:** `src/services/supabase-database.ts`
**Issue:** `getDocuments()` method was fetching ALL documents without organization filtering
**Fix:** Added organizationId parameter and filtering

```typescript
// ✅ BEFORE
static async getDocuments(caseId?: string) {
  // No organization filtering - security issue!

// ✅ AFTER  
static async getDocuments(caseId?: string, organizationId?: number) {
  // Filter by organization_id if provided (for security)
  if (organizationId) {
    query = query.eq('organization_id', organizationId);
  }
```

### Fix #2: Updated useDocuments Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`
**Issue:** Hook wasn't passing user's organization_id to the query
**Fix:** Added useAuth and passed organizationId

```typescript
// ✅ BEFORE
const result = await SupabaseDatabaseService.getDocuments(caseId);

// ✅ AFTER
const { user } = useAuth();
const result = await SupabaseDatabaseService.getDocuments(
  caseId, 
  user?.organization_id || user?.organizationId
);
```

### Fix #3: Fixed Foreign Key References
**File:** `src/services/supabase-database.ts`
**Issue:** Incorrect foreign key constraint names in Supabase query
**Fix:** Simplified foreign key references

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Complex FK names that might not exist
uploaded_user:users!documents_uploaded_by_fkey(...)
verified_user:users!documents_verified_by_fkey(...)

// ✅ AFTER - Simple FK references
uploaded_user:users!uploaded_by(...)
verified_user:users!verified_by(...)
```

### Fix #4: Added Missing Import
**File:** `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`
**Issue:** useAuth was used but not imported
**Fix:** Added import statement

```typescript
// ✅ ADDED
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContextFixed';
```

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check User Object:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('veriphy_user')));
   // Should have organization_id: 1 (or your org ID)
   ```

2. **Check Database Query:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents WHERE organization_id = 1;
   -- Should return > 0 if documents exist
   ```

3. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   Should see:
   ✅ "Fetching documents with caseId: undefined organizationId: 1"
   ✅ No 400/500 errors
   ✅ Documents loading successfully
   ```
