_**Assistant**_

I'll create a cursor rule that allows you to specify a page name and automatically integrate it with Supabase dynamically. Let me first examine the current project structure to understand the existing patterns and then create the rule.

Now let me create a comprehensive cursor rule that will allow you to specify a page name and automatically integrate it with Supabase dynamically. I'll create a `.cursorrules` file:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive cursor rule that will allow you to dynamically integrate any page with Supabase. Here's what I've set up for you:

## 🎯 **Cursor Rule Created: `.cursorrules`**

The cursor rule I created provides a complete framework for dynamically generating Supabase-integrated pages. Here's how it works:

### **How to Use It:**

Simply say: **"Create [PAGE_NAME] page with Supabase integration"**

For example:
- "Create CustomerManagement page with Supabase integration"
- "Create LoanApproval page with Supabase integration" 
- "Create DocumentUpload page with Supabase integration"

### **What It Automatically Generates:**

1. **📊 Database Service Methods** - CRUD operations in `supabase-database.ts`
2. **�� Custom React Hook** - Real-time data fetching with `use[PAGE_NAME]Data()`
3. **📝 TypeScript Interfaces** - Type-safe data structures
4. **⚛️ React Component** - Complete page with loading/error states
5. **�� Real-time Subscriptions** - Live data updates from Supabase
6. **🎨 Consistent UI** - Using your existing design system

### **Key Features Included:**

✅ **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Live data synchronization  
✅ **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages  
✅ **Loading States** - Smooth UX with loading indicators  
✅ **Type Safety** - Complete TypeScript integration  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly layouts  
✅ **Authentication** - Built-in auth checks  
✅ **Audit Logging** - Compliance-ready logging  

### **Example Usage:**

```
User: "Create CustomerManagement page with Supabase integration"

AI will automatically:
1. Add getCustomerManagementData() to database service
2. Create useCustomerManagementData() hook  
3. Define CustomerManagement interface
4. Build CustomerManagementPage component
5. Set up real-time subscriptions
6. Update routing and navigation
```

### **Built-in Patterns:**

The rule follows your existing project patterns:
- Uses your `SupabaseDatabaseService` class
- Integrates with your `AuthContext`
- Follows your UI component structure
- Uses your existing Tailwind CSS classes
- Implements your real-time subscription patterns

### **Banking-Specific Features:**

Since this is a banking application, the rule includes:
- �� **Security-first approach**
- 📋 **Audit trail logging**
- ⚖️ **Compliance requirements**
- 👥 **Multi-tenant support**
- 🏦 **Role-based access control**

Now you can simply mention any page name and it will be completely integrated with Supabase dynamically, following all your project's established patterns and best practices!

Would you like me to demonstrate this by creating a specific page, or do you have any questions about how the cursor rule works?
