Customer names aren’t showing in “All Cases - Assign to Team Members” because `mapCaseData` reads from `customers.users`, but the customers table uses `full_name` directly. Updating `mapCaseData` to use `customers.full_name` and adjusting the query to select it.

Fixed customer name display in "All Cases - Assign to Team Members".

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Database Query (`src/services/supabase-database.ts`)
- Modified `getCasesWithDetails` to select `full_name`, `email`, `mobile`, and `phone` directly from the `customers` table
- Removed the nested `users` join

### 2. Updated Data Mapping (`src/services/supabase-schema-mapping.ts`)
- Updated `mapCaseData` to use `caseData.customers.full_name` directly
- Simplified customer data mapping to use fields from the `customers` table

## Result
Customer names now display correctly in the manager dashboard. The query reads `full_name` from `customers` and maps it to the case data, so names like "Ramesh Gupta", "Deepak Agarwal", and "Rohit Sharma" appear in "All Cases - Assign to Team Members".
